# Analysis Protocols {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

Once you have generated the data from the MiSeq you must complete the following steps in order to analyze the data.


## Software Requirements

The primary software used for analysis is Mothur. This program is command line based, and will require you to type simple commands into either Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).

To download Mothur go to the Mothur github [downloads](https://github.com/mothur/mothur/releases/latest) page and download the latest version for your operating system. Unzip then move this folder to your home directory (your C: Drive on a PC, or your ‘User’ folder on a Mac).

<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Tip</div>
<div class="panel-body">

To check that you have placed the folder in the correct location, open up either Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (PC). Type `~/mothur/mothur` (Mac) or `C:\mothur\mothur.exe` (PC). If your screen looks similar to this:

You have done it correctly.

## Preparing files for analysis

### Downloading sequencing data files from BaseSpace

To download the sequencing fields from BaseSpace. Go to https://basespace.illumina.com/home/index, log-in, and navigate to your sequencing run. Click “Download” and select “All FASTQ files for this run”. Then click “Download your files”. BaseSpace uses the “BaseSpace Downloader” to download your files. If you have not previously downloaded this program, you must download it at this time. Select the location to download your files.

Once your files have downloaded, navigate to the folder where the files were downloaded. There will be one folder that corresponds to each sample that was sequenced. In each of these folders there will be two files, one that corresponds to the forward reads, and one that corresponds to the reverse reads. The forward and reverse read files for all samples will need to be moved to a single folder for analysis to conduct the analysis. 

<div class="panel panel-success">
<div class="panel-heading">Recommendation</div>
<div class="panel-body">

Create a folder on your home directory with the name of your sequencing run (for the rest of this example it will be called “MiSeq_Run”). Move all of your files into this folder.

</div>
</div>

Once the files have been moved, the files must be unzipped/uncompressed. This can be done with the Archive Utility on a Mac and any file compression software, such as WinZip, on a PC. Make sure you unzip your files into the folder that you have created (i.e. “Miseq_Run”)

### Create sample list

You will need to create a file that contains the name of your sample, and specifies which files correspond to this sample. This will tell the program which files to analyze for each particular sample. You can download the file “nemabiome.files” in the [Examples](interpretation.html) section for an example of what this file must look like. Each line in this file represents a single sample that must be analyzed. The first column is the sample name, the second column is the file name for the forward read file, and the third column is the name of the reverse read file. Each column is separated by a single tab.   An example is also listed below.

Example:

```
sample1	sample1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq	 sample1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq
sample2	sample2_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq	 sample2_S2_L001_R2_001.fastq
sample3	sample3_S3_L001_R1_001.fastq	 sample3_S3_L001_R2_001.fastq
...
```

Sample names may vary between different Illumina platforms, so please check the names of your downloaded files, to ensure the file names are correct. Please name this file as “stability.files”, with the “.files” file extension. Place this file in your folder that you created for analysis. This is the only file that you will need to create from scratch for this analysis, if you use the provided files.

### Download analysis files

Download the analysis files <a href="downloads/nematode_ITS2_database_version1_3.fasta" download>Nematode ITS2 database version 1.3</a>,  <a href="downloads/nematode_taxonomy_1_3.tax" download>Nematode taxonomy file (version 1.3)</a> and <a href="downloads/batchfile.txt" download>Mothur batch file</a>. Place these files in the folder that contains your sequencing data (i.e. 'MiSeq_Run')

For a standard application do not make any changes to these files. If you are aware of the number of processors that your computer has, open up the `batchfile.txt` file, go to the first line and change the parameter “processors” from “processors=2” to the number of processors in your computer. 

## Running analysis

Once all files have been downloaded, open up Terminal or Command Prompt. You will then need to navigate to the folder you created, which can be done using the “cd” command. If you created your analysis folder in your home directory type:

```
cd MiSeq_Run
```

This will change to this folder.

Then type:

```
~/mothur/mothur batchfile.txt
```  
(On a Mac)
 
OR

```
C:\mothur\mothur.exe C:\MiSeq_Run\batchfile.txt
``` 
(On a PC)

This will launch Mothur, and begin to complete the commands that are contained within the batchfile. You will need to leave your computer open and running while the analysis completes. The amount of time that it will take to run will vary with your computer, and the number of samples/reads that you will be analyzing. General run times will probably be around ~4 hours, on a standard computer, 96 samples with an average read depth of ~50,000 reads.


Once the analysis has completed, you will have a file called `nemabiome_results.summary`. You can open this file up and copy the contents into an Excel workbook to properly view the data. 

## DADA2 Example Workflow

The following is a sample analysis using the DADA2 pipeline (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html). This is meant to be an example and not a definitive workflow. First we load packages and set a seed for reproducibility.

```{r libraries}
library(DECIPHER)
packageVersion("DECIPHER")

library(dada2)
packageVersion("dada2") 

library(ShortRead)
packageVersion("ShortRead") 

library(Biostrings)
packageVersion("Biostrings")

library(ggplot2)
packageVersion("ggplot2")

library(stringr) # not strictly required but handy
packageVersion("stringr")

set.seed(106)
```

### Setup

To get started we'll need to do a little prep.  We'll start by defining where our raw data files live using the `path` variable.  We then create a vector of file names, one for the forward reads and one for the reverse.  The `samples` vector contains our sample names, extracted from the file names using a regular expression.  For Illumina data, often the sample name is everything before the first underscore.

The primer sequences are defined here as well, because we'll be clipping those off shortly.  The forward primer will be at the beginning of the forward read and the reverse primer will be at the beginning of the reverse read.  The reverse complements are included in case the amplicon sequence is shorter than our read length.  When this happens the sequence will contain the reverse complement of the opposite primer, i.e. there may be reverse-complemented reverse primer at the end of the forward read.

```{r primer_initialization}
path <- "~/MiSeq_Run"

fwd_files <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = "R1", full.names = TRUE)) 
rev_files <- sort(list.files(path, pattern = "R2", full.names = TRUE))

# It's also handy to have a vector of sample names, which in this case is everything up 
# until the first underscore, which is what our regular expression caputres.  You may
# also create this manually if you don't have too many samples
samples = str_extract(basename(fwd_files), "^[^_]+")

names(fwd_files) <- samples
names(rev_files) <- samples

fwd_primer <- "ACGTCTGGTTCAGGGTTGTT"
rev_primer <- "TTAGTTTCTTTTCCTCCGCT"
fwd_primer_rev <- as.character(reverseComplement(DNAStringSet(fwd_primer)))
rev_primer_rev <- as.character(reverseComplement(DNAStringSet(rev_primer)))
```

Before we move on let's do a quick sanity check to make sure our primer sequences are detected.  The code below will count the number of times we have a primer hit in our fastq file.  Note that this is a quick and dirty method to be sure that we have the right primer sequence.  For proper primer removal we'll need something more sophisticated, like `cutadapt` which we'll demonstrate next.

```{r}
# This function counts number of reads in which the primer is found
count_primers <- function(primer, filename) {
  num_hits <- vcountPattern(primer, sread(readFastq(filename)), fixed = FALSE)
  return(sum(num_hits > 0))
}

count_primers(fwd_primer, fwd_files[[1]])
count_primers(rev_primer, rev_files[[1]])
```

### Primer removal

Now we can use cutadapt to remove primers, and check that they have been successfully removed.  Cutadapt was designed to remove sequencing adapters that sometimes get left on the reads, however, it's main function is to detect and trim off regions that match a known sequence, which is precisely what we want to do here.  

Cutadapt is best installed using conda (`conda install cutadapt`) and can also be used directly from the command line.  Here we demonstrate how to run it directly from R using the `system2` command but the results are the same either way.  The first parameter to `system2` is the program we wish to run and the second is character vector of arguments and their values.

```{r}

# CHANGE ME to the cutadapt path on your machine.  If you've installed conda according to the 
# provided instructions then this will likely be the same for you.
cutadapt <- path.expand("~/miniconda3/bin/cutadapt")

# Make sure it works
system2(cutadapt, args = "--version") 
```

Now output filenames are defined as well as parameters for cutadapt.  The critical parameters are the primer sequences and their orientation.  It's strongly recommended that you review the [cutadapt documentation] (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) for full details of each parameter.  Briefly:

`-g`: sequence to trim off the 5' end of the forward read (forward primer)
`-a`: sequence to trim off the 3' end of the forward read (reverse complemented reverse primer)
`-G`: sequence to trim off the 5' end of the reverse read (reverse primer)
`-A`: sequence to trim off the 3' end of the reverse read (reverse complemented forward primer)

We'll also add `-m 50` to get rid of super short junky reads, `--max-n 1` to get rid of reads that have any N's in them and `-n 2` so that cutadapt will remove multiple primer hits if there happens to be read-through.  The `--discard-untrimmed` is also added so only reads that contain a primer will be kept ensuring we keep only valid amplicons.   And finally a `-q 15` will trim off low quality bases from the 3' end.  

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <p>In our experience this small amount of trimming can remove the need for truncating the reads later on but this is something that may vary from run to run it and an important paramter to consider for your own data </p>
</div>

```{r}

# Create an output directory to store the clipped files
cut_dir <- file.path(path, "cutadapt")
if (!dir.exists(cut_dir)) dir.create(cut_dir)

fwd_cut <- file.path(cut_dir, basename(fwd_files))
rev_cut <- file.path(cut_dir, basename(rev_files))

names(fwd_cut) <- samples
names(rev_cut) <- samples

# It's good practice to keep some log files so let's create some
# file names that we can use for those 
cut_logs <- path.expand(file.path(cut_dir, paste0(samples, ".log")))

cutadapt_args <- c("-g", fwd_primer, "-a", rev_primer_rev, 
                   "-G", rev_primer, "-A", fwd_primer_rev,
                   "-n", 2, "--discard-untrimmed")

# Loop over the list of files, running cutadapt on each file.  If you don't have a vector of sample names or 
# don't want to keep the log files you can set stdout = "" to output to the console or stdout = NULL to discard
for (i in seq_along(fwd_files)) {
  system2(cutadapt, 
          args = c(cutadapt_args,
                   "-o", fwd_cut[i], "-p", rev_cut[i], 
                   fwd_files[i], rev_files[i]),
          stdout = cut_logs[i])  
}

# quick check that we got something
head(list.files(cut_dir))
```

### Inspect quality scores

Now that primers are removed, we can begin the DADA2 pipeline in full. We start with plotting quality profiles of our sequences to determine suitable quality filtering parameters. For the sake of speed we only show 2 samples here but feel free to look at all your samples (or more than 2 anyway).

```{r quality_profiles}
plotQualityProfile(fwd_cut[1:2]) + ggtitle("Forward")
```

Everything looks pretty good here.  The majority of our reads should be 230 bp based on the fact that we trimmed 20 bp primers off the beginning of the read.  It looks like a very, very few did not get trimmed properly but from the red line across the bottom, which is the number of reads of that length, we can see that this is such a small percentage that we don't need to worry about it.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <h4 class="alert-heading">Side note</h4>
  <p>If you're paying attention you might be asking why, if the primers always appear at the same point in the read, can't we just clip the reads at this point.  In fact, for some datasets, this one included, that would be a valid strategy given that the all the ITS2 sequences are longer than the read length (250 bp).  However, this is not always the case and as described above, if the amplicon length is less than the read lenght we'll have to find and remove the opposite primer.  So in general it's good practice to use something like cutadapt which will ensure the correct sequences are output. </p>
</div>


```{r}
plotQualityProfile(rev_cut[1:2]) + ggtitle("Reverse")
```

Reverse reads are lower quality as is always the case for Illumina data.  However, it looks like the quality average is above 20 for most of the length of the read so we'll go ahead with the analysis.


### Quality filtering

For the purposes of our analysis, we chose to conduct quality filtering with maximum expected errors of 2 for the forward sequence, 5 for the reverse, to truncate after a quality score of 2 or lower.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <p>Make your own decisions about trimming paramters!  Your data will be different, possibly very different, from ours so our parmeter choices are likely to be not at all appropriate for your data.  So don't copy and paste this code - think carefully about your data and choose parameters appropriate for your data.</p>
</div>


```{r}

# Same as for the clippling we create an output directory to store the filtered files
filt_dir <- file.path(path, "filtered")
if (!dir.exists(filt_dir)) dir.create(filt_dir)

fwd_filt <- file.path(filt_dir, basename(fwd_files))
rev_filt <- file.path(filt_dir, basename(rev_files))

names(fwd_filt) <- samples
names(rev_filt) <- samples

filtered_out <- filterAndTrim(
  fwd = fwd_cut, 
  filt = fwd_filt,
  rev = rev_cut,
  filt.rev = rev_filt,
  maxEE = c(2, 5), 
  truncQ = 2, 
  rm.phix = TRUE, 
  compress = TRUE, 
  multithread = TRUE
  )  

head(filtered_out)
```


### Main dada2 workflow

Much of the remainder of the dada2 workflow is very well documented in the main dada2 tutorial so if you'd like to read in more detail please that tutorial as well as the dada2 paper.

#### Learn errors

Here dada2 learns the error profile for your data using an interative approach.  These error profiles are used in the next step to correct errors. 

```{r}

err_fwd <- learnErrors(fwd_filt, multithread = TRUE)
err_rev <- learnErrors(rev_filt, multithread = TRUE)

plotErrors(err_fwd, nominalQ = TRUE)
```
The plot shows how well the estimated error rates fit the observed rates.  The black line should line up reasonably well with the black points.  This looks reasonable so we continue on.

#### Denoising (aka error-correcting)

We can now denoise our sequences using the DADA algorithm. Note that older versions of dada2 required a dereplication step that is now done automatically by the `dada` function.  

```{r denoise}
dada_fwd <- dada(fwd_filt, err = err_fwd, multithread = TRUE)
dada_rev <- dada(rev_filt, err = err_rev, multithread = TRUE)
```

#### Merge pairs

Now that we have accurate sequences we can merge the paired-end reads to reconstruct the full amplicon sequence.  Note that most sequences should succesfully overlap, _unless_ your trimming parameters were too aggresive (i.e. too much sequence was trimmed off the end) _or_ you have amplicons that longer than the combined read length (>500 bp, in this case). In the latter case these reads are still useable but will need special handling (more details to come on those cases).

```{r merge}
mergers <- mergePairs(
  dadaF = dada_fwd,
  dadaR = dada_rev,
  derepF = fwd_filt,
  derepR = rev_filt,
  maxMismatch = 1, 
  verbose=TRUE
)

```


#### Sequence table

Before we can assign taxonomy, we can construct a sequence table, which lists the number of each sequence present in each sample.  We can see the dimensions of this sequence table, where the number of rows is the number of samples and the number of columns is the number of total unique sequences

```{r seq_table}
seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(mergers)
dim(seqtab) 
```


#### Remove chimeras 

Don't be alarmed here if many of your sequences are discarded - the number of chimeras varies but can be quite high in some cases.

```{r}
seqtab_nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(seqtab, method = "consensus", multithread = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
dim(seqtab_nochim)

```

### How did we do?

#### Sequence length distribution

```{r}
table(nchar(getSequences(seqtab_nochim)))
```

#### Number of reads at each step

This is an important step, particularly if you're trying to track down where something went wrong.

```{r}
# small function to get the number of sequences
getN <- function(x) sum(getUniques(x))

track <- cbind(
  filtered_out, 
  sapply(dada_fwd, getN), 
  sapply(dada_rev, getN), 
  sapply(mergers, getN), 
  rowSums(seqtab_nochim)
)

colnames(track) <- c("raw", "filtered", "denoised_fwd", "denoised_rev", "merged", "no_chim")
rownames(track) <- samples  
head(track)
```
