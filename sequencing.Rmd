#### Protocol

1. UV treat plasticware and mol grade water for 15 min prior to PCR set-up
2. Combine 2.5 $\mu$l of each of the forward primers at stock concentration (100 nM) to 90 $\mu$l of mol grade water to achieve forward primer mix at 10nM working concentration. Do the same for the reverse primers.
3. On ice make-up Mastermix using forward and reverse primer mixes and the recipe below.
4. Aliquot mastermix (21 $\mu$l) to each well of 96-well plate
5. Add 4 $\mu$l template (lysate dilution) to wells using multi-channel pipetter
6. Place microseal "A" film over completed plate and place on thermocycler (with pre-heated lid) and run the program below.  



```{r}

*Cycles kept low to limit potential bias, but can be increased to 30-35 cycles for samples with low DNA. If amplicons are not to be cleaned immediately store at -20. It is not advisable though to delay the library preparation process as PCR products will degrade even at -20 if stored for longer than a couple of days*

### Magnetic bead purification  

#### Reagents required
* AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, A63881) - Aliquot and store at $4\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$
* 96-well Magnetic-Ring stand (Applied biosystems, AM10050)
* 0.8 ml 96-well storage plates (Thermo-Scientific, AB-0859)
* 0.2 ml 96-well plate, clear, half-skirted (VWR, 83007-374)
* 8-channel pipetters
* Reagent reservoirs
* absolute ethanol (mol grade)  
* mol. grade water  

<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Note</div>
<div class="panel-body">

*Filter aerosol pipette tips and 8-channel pipetter used for majority of steps in this protocol. Also all quantities quoted are for clean-up of a full plate (96 samples)*  

</div>
</div>

#### Protocol
1. Bring an aliquot of AMPure beads to room temp  
2. Prepare fresh 80% ethanol from mol grade absolute ethanol (50 ml)   
3. Centrifuge amplification plate to collect condensation (300 G for 2 min)  
4. Remove seal from plate in biosafety cabinet (if possible)  
5. Transfer the 25 $\mu$l reactions into 0.8 ml 96-well storage plates using multi-channel pipettor  
6. Voretx beads for 30 sec to ensure even disperal before placing in reagent reservoir  
7. Transfer 25 $\mu$l of beads to each well of the storage plate and gently pipet up and down 10 times to ensure the beads are well-mixed with the PCR sample  
8. Incubate at room temp for 5 min  
9. Place plate on magnetic stand for 2 min (or until supernatent has cleared)
10. Once clear use multi-channel pipettor to remove and discard supernatent from the wells  
11. With the plate still on the magnetic stand, wash beads with 80% ethanol by adding 200 $\mu$l to each well (using a multi-channel pipetter and a reagent reservoir). Do not resuspend the beads at this point  
12. Incubate for 30 sec (or until clear) and then remove and discard supernatent  
13. Wash again with another 200 $\mu$l of 80% ethanol. Incubate for 30 sec and then as before remove and discard supernatant.  
14. Use a small volume single-channel pipettor (P20, with fine tips) to remove excess ethanol from each well  
15. Allow beads to air-dry for 15 min  
16. Remove plate from magnetic stand  
17. Add 40 $\mu$l of mol grade water to each well with multi-channel pipettor and gently pipet up and down 10 times to re-suspend the beads  
18. Incubate at room temp for 2 min  
19. Place the plate back on the magnetic stand for 2 min (or until cleared)  
20. Transfer approx 34 $\mu$l of the supernatent to a new 0.2 ml 96-well plate without touching the beads  
21. A microseal "A" is placed over cleaned-up samples to allow temporary storage at $-20\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$

#### Individual sample quantification and pooling

1. Nanodrop quantification of cleaned-up products resulting from second round of PCR
2. Make normalized library by combining samples into a single tube to ensure all samples are present in equal concentrations (typically combine 50 ng per sample).This should ensure uniform coverage of reads for all samples in the library.
3. Nanodrop library and dilute with mol grade water to achieve approx 5 ng/$\mu$l



## Library Quantification

<div class="panel panel-info">
<div class="panel-heading">Note</div>
